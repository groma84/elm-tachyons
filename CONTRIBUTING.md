Contributors are welcome!

Rules are:
1. Discuss in an Issue first
2. Make sure it compiles and you've run ./build.sh
3. Run prettier.js on your JS code and elm-format on Elm
6. _don't bump the package version_
3. Make a PR and describe both WHY your changes are needed
4. Reference the issue
5. Wait for a reply (sorry I take a long time somtimes).

Thanks so much for helping!
